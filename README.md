# first_sinatra_api - an Einstein random quote generator

My first API in Sinatra. Unbelievably simple. Sinatra provides a lovely routing mechanism. 

Einstein had amazing things to say about every aspect of life, not just science. He has as much insight into the joy of discovery as to the thrill of a lovely woman's company.
